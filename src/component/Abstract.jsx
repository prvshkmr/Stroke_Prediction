      Stroke, a leading cause of mortality and long-term disability worldwide, necessitates proactive measures for timely intervention and prevention. This abstract outlines a predictive modeling approach aimed at forecasting stroke occurrence in at-risk populations. Leveraging machine learning techniques and extensive clinical data, including demographic information, medical history, lifestyle factors, and biomarkers, our model achieves high accuracy and reliability in identifying individuals predisposed to stroke. By analyzing large-scale datasets from diverse cohorts, we elucidate significant risk factors and their interplay, facilitating personalized risk assessment and targeted intervention strategies. Furthermore, our model's interpretability aids healthcare professionals in understanding the underlying mechanisms driving stroke susceptibility, fostering informed decision-making and tailored patient care. This research contributes to the advancement of stroke prediction methodologies, offering a valuable tool for preemptive healthcare interventions and ultimately reducing the burden of stroke-related morbidity and mortality.
